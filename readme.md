# România — de la statul totalitar la statul de drept

A history themed web site I build in high school for a competition in 2006.
Didn't win nothing.

You can [view the website][rawgit] using rawgit.com (you may want to [skip
directly to the content][content]).

I archived so many intermediary versions that I can reconstruct the building
process reasonably well.
